# Escrow Manager

## Executive Summary

The **Escrow Manager** is a purpose-built application that ensures the integrity and security of digital asset offerings by introducing a system of checks and balances across both onchain and offchain transactions. It provides a transparent, automated, and auditable environment for managing investor funds through qualified custodians, escrow agents, or issuer-designated agents. By combining **smart contracts, blockchain automation, and API-driven integrations with traditional banking systems**, the Escrow Manager safeguards investors while simplifying fund reconciliation for issuers and custodians.

## Overview

The Escrow Manager functions as the trusted layer between investors, issuers, and custodians, ensuring that funds are securely held and only released under predefined conditions. It supports a variety of offering types:

- **Regulated digital securities offerings** (requiring qualified custodians such as banks, trust companies, or broker-dealers).
- **Non-regulated offerings** (e.g., utility token sales), where issuers may designate escrow wallets and bank accounts without the need for licensed custodians.

By supporting both **onchain escrow (crypto wallets)** and **offchain escrow (bank accounts)**, the Escrow Manager provides issuers and investors with a complete solution that covers all payment flows, reconciliations, cancellations, and refunds.

## Capabilities

### 1. Onchain Escrow and Smart Contract Automation

- Automatically transfers onchain investments into wallets held under the custody of qualified third-party custodians.
- Upon successful completion of the offering, smart contracts transfer funds to the issuer.
- If the offering is canceled or fails to meet its terms, funds are automatically returned to investors.
- Supports investor-initiated cancellations before offering close, ensuring investor protection.

### 2. Offchain Escrow Integration

- Enables issuers or custodians to track fiat payments made via ACH, wire transfer, or payment cards.
- Integrates with banking APIs to detect fund receipts in escrow bank accounts.
- Ensures digital assets are only released after offchain funds have been confirmed and signed off by the escrow agent.
- Prevents premature issuance of digital assets by synchronizing with the Admin App.

### 3. Reconciliation and Recordkeeping

- Provides dashboards for escrow agents to review onchain and offchain transactions.
- Tracks pending, canceled, and returned transactions across both investment types.
- Generates downloadable reconciliation and reporting data to support audits, compliance checks, and Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.
- Maintains a full audit trail of approvals, refunds, and reconciliations.

### 4. Investor Protection

- Ensures that no funds are released unless offering terms are met.
- Allows escrow agents or custodians to authorize refunds in the case of cancellations or failed offerings.
- Provides investors with confidence through secure fund custody, return logistics, and compliance with offering conditions.

### 5. Modular and Flexible Architecture

- Automatically deactivates onchain or offchain functionality depending on the structure of the offering.
- Adaptable for **100% onchain**, **100% offchain**, or **hybrid investment flows**.
- Designed to evolve with market needs, supporting new features and integrations through a modular framework.

### 6. Security and Access Controls

- Secured with **two-factor authentication** for all escrow agents and custodians.
- Supports passkey-based authentication for seamless and secure login.
- Provides role-based access, ensuring that only authorized parties can reconcile funds or approve refunds.
