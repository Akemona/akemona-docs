### Ensuring Trust, Transparency, and Protection in Every Transaction

The **Secure Payments** capability is a core feature integrated into the **Investor Portal** and managed through the **Admin App**. It enables investors to make both onchain and offchain investments with confidence, ensuring that every transaction is transparent, tamper-proof, and fully compliant with financial regulations.

By combining blockchain automation with secure financial APIs, our platform ensures that investor funds are protected, payments are reconciled, and digital assets are issued only when funds are properly received.



## Onchain Payments

Onchain payments leverage the transparency and security of blockchain technology.

* **Smart Contract Authorization**: Investors approve the amount to be invested directly from their own wallets. Smart contracts cannot withdraw funds without the investor’s explicit approval.
* **Atomic Transactions**: The smart contract executes a single all-or-none process:

  * Withdraw funds from the investor’s wallet (to the escrow wallet).
  * Issue corresponding digital assets immediately.
* **Full Transparency**: The code of the smart contract is verifiable onchain by investors or their representatives before committing funds.
* **No Misuse of Permissions**: Since investor approval is transaction-specific, permissions cannot be reused or misapplied.
* **Tamper-Proof Assurance**: It is technically impossible for funds to be taken without simultaneously issuing the corresponding digital assets.

This mechanism guarantees **funds and assets move together**, removing risks of fraud or operational errors in onchain payments.



## Offchain Payments

For offchain payments, the Investor Portal integrates with trusted financial APIs and banking rails:

* **Secure API Connections**: Payments are processed via secure integrations with providers such as **Plaid** and regulated banking institutions.
* **ACH Transfers**: Investors can make ACH payments seamlessly through APIs without manually entering sensitive payment details.
* **Wire Transfers**: For larger investments, investors can initiate direct wire transfers to escrow accounts.
* **Payment Card Options**: Depending on offering configuration, cards may also be supported with full PCI-DSS compliant handling.
* **Data Protection**: The Investor Portal does not store investor payment details, ensuring maximum data security.

This approach minimizes fraud risk, eliminates unnecessary exposure of sensitive data, and ensures compliance with banking security standards.



## Admin Oversight & Investor Protection

All onchain and offchain transactions are actively **monitored and controlled** via the **Admin App**:

* **Compliance Monitoring**: Admins can track every payment and ensure it aligns with offering terms and KYC/AML verification.
* **Fraud Prevention**: If any suspicious activity is detected, admins can immediately block transactions to safeguard investors.
* **Reconciliation**: Both onchain and offchain payments are reconciled with escrow accounts to ensure that assets are issued only when funds are received.



## Why Secure Payments Matter

Financial regulators globally — including the **SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission)**, **FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)**, and global banking authorities — emphasize investor protection, transparency, and fraud prevention. Secure payments are essential to:

* Prevent unauthorized transfers.
* Ensure that investor funds are safeguarded during the investment process.
* Provide verifiable, auditable records for compliance and audits.
* Build investor trust in blockchain-based securities and digital assets.



## Key Benefits

* **Onchain Trust**: Atomic smart contract transactions ensure fairness and transparency.
* **Offchain Safety**: Bank-grade APIs secure ACH, wire, and card payments.
* **No Data Exposure**: Sensitive payment details are never stored on the Investor Portal.
* **Admin Safeguards**: Oversight tools empower admins to protect investors proactively.
* **Global Compliance**: Secure Payments align with regulatory standards for digital assets and financial services.



With Secure Payments, investors can confidently participate in offerings, knowing that their funds and digital assets are always protected through **blockchain automation, secure banking integrations, and compliance oversight**.


Here’s a refined version of your footnote language that makes the **risks, disclaimers, and security implications** very clear while sounding professional and investor-focused:



**⚠️ Important Wire Transfer Notice**
Investors must carefully verify all wire transfer instructions **directly within the Akemona Investor Portal** before initiating any transfer. For security reasons, **do not rely on wire transfer instructions received via email, text, or phone call**, as these may be fraudulent. Always confirm that you are sending funds to the correct receiving account as displayed on the portal.

If you have any doubts about the accuracy of wire transfer details, please contact **[support@akemona.com](mailto:support@akemona.com)** immediately for verification.

**Disclaimer:** Wire transfers are executed outside the Akemona platform and are under the sole control of the investor and their bank. Akemona does not control the movement of funds once a wire transfer has been initiated. If funds are sent to an incorrect or unauthorized account, they may be **irretrievable**, and Akemona may not be able to assist in recovering them.
