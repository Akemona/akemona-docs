# Introduction to Akemona Tokenization Cloud



Akemona has developed a **powerful end-to-end digital asset issuance and management platform** that supports both the **sell-side and buy-side** of the digital asset ecosystem in the **primary market**. Our solution enables the issuance, management, and investment of **tokenized securities and utility tokens** under U.S. securities exemptions and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

* **Utility tokens** issued without securities are not regulated by the SEC and may be distributed outside securities exemptions.
* **Issuers** may also issue stablecoins, governance tokens, and other forms of network tokens through the platform.

Using Akemona, issuers can raise capital through digital assets offered under the exempt offering framework of the SEC:

* **Regulation A**
* **Regulation D**
* **Regulation S**
* **Investment Companies 1940 Act**
* **Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF)**

While Akemona’s platform is pre-configured to support regulated offerings under **Reg CF, Reg A, Reg D, Reg S, and the Investment Company Act of 1940**, issuers should not limit themselves to thinking only within this framework. The **Akemona Tokenization Cloud** is capable of creating and managing virtually **any type of digital asset** imaginable—from **stablecoins, governance tokens, utility tokens, and network tokens** to **mutual fund shares, debt instruments, and bonds**. With thousands of APIs and smart contracts, the system is **highly configurable** and can be re-engineered to meet the specifications of novel asset classes, including tokens not backed by real-world assets (e.g., **memecoins**). By design, our platform enables issuers to think **beyond regulatory exemptions** and explore the full breadth of digital asset innovation.

Using the Akemona platform, utility tokens can also be issued as perks or dividends to holders of security tokens, adding utility and value for investors. In 2024, Akemona successfully introduced the tokenization platform with three Reg CF offerings. By August 2024, our white-label SaaS platform was used to launch two real estate offerings—one for \$10 million under Reg A and another for \$100 million under Reg D.

All investors on our platform are verified through rigorous KYC/AML processes and classified as accredited or non-accredited. This verification ensures compliance with SEC rules, including investment limits based on investor type under Reg CF and Reg A.

Akemona Tokenization Cloud is bundled in the following packages:

1. **Akemona Core**
2. **Akemona Cloud**
3. **Akemona Enterprise**

### Our Apps Can Operate on Permissioned and Permissionless Blockchain Networks

**Permissioned Blockchain Infrastructure**
We are currently collaborating with financial institutions and banks across the U.S. and Latin America. To meet the growing demand for secure, private, and regulation-compliant digital asset infrastructure, Akemona has developed extensive smart contracts, APIs, and web3 interfaces which can be used with permissioned or permissionless blockchains. The Akemona blockchain infrastructure supports our full suite of applications while enabling secure, peer-to-peer trading of security tokens among verified investors.

For digital asset security tokens, our permissioned network integrates multiple KYC/AML providers and accredited investor verification services. Once verified, investors can invest and trade tokenized securities based on their regulatory status. All offerings, investments, payments, settlements, and post-issuance services will be processed through our integrated apps on this secure blockchain.

Security tokens remain tradable only within the permissioned blockchain to preserve compliance with securities laws. However, utility tokens distributed as perks or dividends can be bridged and traded on public EVM-compatible blockchains. Akemona will offer interoperability services to facilitate this.

**Permissionless Blockchain Infrastructure**
Our smart contracts work seamlessly on permissionless public blockchain networks like Ethereum. All services and functionality available on permissioned blockchain infrastructure are also available on permissionless public blockchain networks.

We support broker/dealers in tokenizing shares and facilitating compliant capital raises. This ecosystem is especially valuable for businesses that have traditionally avoided private securities due to high friction and low liquidity. By reducing transaction costs, increasing transparency, enabling compliance, and supporting faster settlements, we are building the future of digital finance—powered by real-world assets.
