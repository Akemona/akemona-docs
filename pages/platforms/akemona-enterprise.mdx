## Tokenization Cloud for Enterprises

At the heart of Akemona Enterprise lies the **Akemona Tokenization Cloud**—a secure, scalable, and modular infrastructure designed to power the most ambitious digital asset initiatives.

Unlike off-the-shelf tokenization products, **Akemona Enterprise gives you direct access to the full capabilities of the Tokenization Cloud**, including:

- **Thousands of APIs and pre-built smart contracts** for rapid innovation.
- **EVM-compatible blockchain infrastructure**, deployable across permissioned and public networks.
- **Configurable rules engines** to enforce business logic, compliance, and governance.
- **Secure data management layers**, ensuring sensitive customer information is never exposed on public blockchains.
- **Integration with leading third-party platforms**, including payment processors (Plaid, banks), KYC/AML services (Trulioo, OFAC), and enterprise CRMs (Salesforce).

For enterprise customers, the Tokenization Cloud is not just an engine for issuing securities—it’s a **flexible digital fabric** that can be extended into **new industries, new business models, and entirely new classes of digital assets.**
