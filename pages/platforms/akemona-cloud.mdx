# Akemona Cloud
**Your Branded Tokenization Platform, Powered by Akemona**

Akemona Cloud is a fully branded, white-label tokenization solution offered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Built on the Akemona Tokenization Cloud,
this service enables businesses and financial institutions to launch and manage digital asset offerings under their own domain and brand—without
managing infrastructure or developing software.

You manage the offering. We deliver the technology—preconfigured, rebranded, and ready to deploy.

## What is Tokenization Cloud?

The financial world is shifting toward **digital-first, blockchain-enabled infrastructures**, and Akemona is at the forefront of this transformation. Our **Tokenization Cloud** is a secure, pre-configured Web3 environment that combines:

* **EVM-compatible smart contracts**
* **Web3 APIs and user interfaces**
* **Rules engines and compliance modules**
* **Secure centralized databases** (for sensitive information that cannot be exposed on public blockchains)
* **Content management systems and design frameworks**
* **Bank-grade security and encryption protocols**

This cloud-native infrastructure runs on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and integrates seamlessly with **industry-standard APIs** like **Plaid (offchain payments), Salesforce (CRM), and Trulioo/OFAC systems for KYC/AML checks**.

The Tokenization Cloud enables businesses to build and operate decentralized applications (dApps) with speed and reliability, supporting both **public blockchains** (e.g., Ethereum) and **permissioned blockchains** (for compliant, private ecosystems). All of Akemona’s applications—including **Issuer Hub, Investor Portal, Admin App, Escrow Manager, Fund Manager, and OnchainTA**—are built on this robust infrastructure.



## Introducing Akemona Cloud

**Akemona Cloud** is our **white-label, branded SaaS product** that empowers businesses to run their own tokenization ecosystem under **their domain name, their branding, and their client experience**.

While **Akemona Core** offers a shared-tokenization space on the Akemona domain, **Akemona Cloud gives each business a private and dedicated instance of the Tokenization Cloud**, seamlessly integrated with their existing website and operations.

Key features of Akemona Cloud include:

* **Private, Branded Environment** – Your platform, your domain, your branding. Akemona Cloud blends seamlessly into your digital presence.
* **Full Customer Ownership** – Unlike Core, where Akemona provides shared support, Akemona Cloud enables you to **directly manage your customers** using integrated CRM tools.
* **Unlimited Asset Issuance** – Launch and manage as many tokenized securities, stablecoins, utility tokens, governance tokens, bonds, or other custom tokens as your business requires.
* **Managed Blockchain Infrastructure** – Akemona continues to manage the underlying Tokenization Cloud, ensuring compliance, uptime, scalability, and integration with KYC/AML systems.



## Why Choose Akemona Cloud?

### 1. **Your Brand, Not Ours**

### 3. **Rapid Deployment**

Akemona Cloud can be customized, branded, and launched in **weeks, not months**. Our short onboarding and training program ensures your team is fully ready to operate the platform—no programming knowledge required.

### 4. **Compliance by Design**

Your Cloud package comes with integrated **KYC/AML verification, accredited investor checks, OFAC screening, and payments compliance tools**. This makes it simple to launch tokenized offerings under **Reg CF, Reg A, Reg D, Reg S, the 1940 Act**, or any other legal framework worldwide.

### 5. **End-to-End Digital Asset Lifecycle Management**

From fundraising to settlement, from portfolio management to secondary transfers—**every lifecycle stage is automated, secure, and compliant** in Akemona Cloud.
