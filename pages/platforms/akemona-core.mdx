**Launch Digital Assets with Ease on Our Tokenization Cloud**


## What is Tokenization Cloud?

Akemona is a pioneer in delivering blockchain and Web3 infrastructure for capital markets and beyond. Our **Tokenization Cloud** is a secure, pre-configured, cloud-based environment that combines **Web3 APIs, smart contracts, rules engines, centralized databases, content management systems, and security protocols** into a unified service architecture.

Built on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and seamlessly integrating industry-standard solutions such as **Plaid (offchain payments), Salesforce (CRM), and OFAC/AML compliance APIs**, our Tokenization Cloud provides the building blocks to rapidly develop, deploy, and manage decentralized applications (dApps) on both **public** and **permissioned blockchains**.

Every Akemona application—**Issuer Hub, Investor Portal, Admin App, Escrow Manager, Fund Manager, and OnchainTA**—is powered by Tokenization Cloud. This infrastructure ensures that every tokenized asset created on Akemona’s platform is compliant, secure, scalable, and designed for real-world adoption.
