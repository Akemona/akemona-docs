# OnchainTA – Non-Custodial Transfer Agent for Digital Asset Securities

## Executive Summary

OnchainTA is one of the first **non-custodial transfer agents** designed specifically for digital asset securities. Unlike traditional transfer agents or custodial models, OnchainTA does not hold investor assets. Instead, investors retain ownership of their securities in their own wallets, while OnchainTA provides the regulatory, compliance, and operational functions required of a transfer agent.

Through a combination of **smart contracts, web3 interfaces, and compliance frameworks**, OnchainTA ensures that securities transfers, replacements, corporate actions, and shareholder recordkeeping are executed seamlessly onchain while remaining compliant with U.S. securities regulations.

This innovative approach redefines the transfer agent model by introducing transparency, efficiency, and investor empowerment while preserving the regulatory safeguards expected in capital markets.



## Overview

OnchainTA sits at the core of the post-subscription and post-settlement lifecycle for digital asset securities. It delivers three foundational advantages:

1. **Non-Custodial Operation** – Investors retain control of their assets in their wallets; OnchainTA does not hold securities.
2. **Automated Compliance** – Transfers, replacements, and corporate actions are executed through smart contracts that ensure SEC compliance.
3. **Peer-to-Peer Enablement** – Investors can directly trade with each other without intermediaries, while OnchainTA enforces regulatory constraints such as holding periods and whitelist verification.

This model creates a transparent, auditable, and investor-centric framework for the administration of digital asset securities.
