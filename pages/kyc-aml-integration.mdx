# KYC/AML Integration

## Executive Summary

**KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance** are critical requirements for any financial platform dealing with digital assets. The Akemona ecosystem integrates KYC/AML processes seamlessly across its **Investor Portal, Admin App, and Escrow Manager** to ensure that all participants are properly verified, transactions are compliant with international and U.S. regulations, and risks related to fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing are mitigated.

The integration is designed to balance **regulatory compliance, investor protection, and operational efficiency** by leveraging third-party providers such as **Plaid** and **Trulioo**, while also supporting manual review by lead managers and custodians. By embedding KYC/AML functionality into multiple layers of the platform, Akemona ensures that compliance is not an afterthought but a **core capability across the entire digital asset lifecycle**.

## Overview

KYC/AML Integration is not a standalone application; it is a **capability built into all three core apps**:

- **Investor Portal** – Collects identity data, initiates KYC/AML at the time of first investment, and verifies wallets.
- **Admin App** – Manages KYC/AML workflows, integrates with OFAC screening, and controls issuance of digital assets.
- **Escrow Manager** – Ensures custodians only hold funds from verified investors, reconciling KYC/AML status before releasing funds.

This integration ensures that **no digital asset is issued, and no investment is accepted, unless the investor has passed all required KYC/AML checks**.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Investor Portal – Onboarding & Identity Collection

- **Initial Registration**: Collects basic data such as name, address, email, phone, and registered crypto wallets.
- **Investment Triggered KYC/AML**: Investors provide SSN, Tax ID, passport, or other government-issued IDs at the time of their first investment.
- **Global Compliance**: Non-U.S. persons provide passport copies and proof of address (e.g., utility bills).
- **Wallet Verification**: Registered wallets are tied to verified identities, enabling asset recovery and compliance with securities regulations.

### 2. Admin App – Compliance Oversight & OFAC Screening

- **Third-Party Verification**: Integrates with services like Plaid or Trulioo for automated KYC/AML checks.
- **Manual Review**: Lead managers can follow up with investors if automated checks fail and manually approve once compliance is confirmed.
- **OFAC Integration**: The Admin App is connected to the **U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC lists**, ensuring investors and wallet addresses are screened against sanctioned entities.
- **Flagging System**: Once verified, an investor’s account is flagged as “KYC/AML approved,” enabling issuance of digital assets.

### 3. Escrow Manager – Custodian & Fund Verification

- **Investor Fund Protection**: Custodians and escrow agents confirm that funds come only from verified investors.
- **Integrated Status Checks**: All KYC/AML status data is shared with the Escrow Manager, allowing custodians to block or return funds if an investor is not verified.
- **Full Audit Trail**: Ensures traceability of funds and regulatory compliance for both onchain and offchain escrow.

## Compliance with Laws and Regulations

KYC/AML Integration supports compliance with a wide range of **U.S. and international financial regulations**, including:

- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** – Requires financial institutions to verify customer identities and report suspicious activity.
- **USA PATRIOT Act** – Expands AML obligations to prevent terrorism financing.
- **OFAC Sanctions Programs** – Prohibits transactions with sanctioned individuals, entities, and wallet addresses.
- **FinCEN Guidelines** – Require digital asset platforms to implement AML programs and file suspicious activity reports.
- **FATF Recommendations (Global)** – Provides global standards on customer due diligence (CDD) and AML measures.
- **EU AML Directives (AMLD5/AMLD6)** – Extends AML obligations to cryptocurrency platforms within the European Union.

By adhering to these laws and frameworks, Akemona ensures that its platform can operate in a **globally compliant and scalable manner**, supporting both U.S. and international investors.
